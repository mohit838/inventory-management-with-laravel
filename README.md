# Inventory Management System (Laravel 11)

A clean, loosely coupled, and production-ready Inventory Management API built with **Laravel 11** and **PHP 8.3**.

---

## 🚀 Features

-   **📦 Inventory Core**: Hierarchical **Categories**, **Subcategories**, and **Products**.
-   **🛒 Order Management**: Transactional order processing with automated stock deduction.
-   **🕵️ Automated Audit Logs**: Model Observers listen for database events to log every change automatically.
-   **🖼️ Media Management**: Seamless integration with **MinIO (S3-compatible)** for secure image storage.
-   **🔐 Security**: Stateless **JWT Authentication** with **RBAC** (Role-Based Access Control).
-   **⚡ Performance**: Built-in **Redis Caching** and eager-loaded Eloquent relationships.
-   **📖 API Documentation**: Auto-generated **OpenAPI/Swagger** docs (separated from controllers for cleanliness).

## 🏗️ Architecture: Clean & Loosely Coupled

This project follows a professional **Controller -> Service -> Repository Interface** architecture.

### 🧩 Loose Coupling (Dependency Inversion)
Unlike standard Laravel tutorials, this project depends on **Interfaces** rather than concrete classes.
-   **Controllers** type-hint an `Interface` (e.g., `ProductRepositoryInterface`).
-   **Laravel Service Container** binds the interface to an `Eloquent implementation` via `RepositoryServiceProvider`.
-   **Benefit**: You can swap the database or repository logic without touching the controllers.

### 📂 Directory Structure
-   `app/Interfaces`: Contains all Repository and Service contracts.
-   `app/Repositories`: Contains the Eloquent-specific implementations.
-   `app/Services`: Handles complex business logic (e.g., `OrderService`).
-   `app/Http/Resources`: Standardizes API output format.
-   `app/Observers`: Handles background tasks like audit logging.

## 🐳 Docker & DevOps

The project uses a high-performance **Nginx + PHP-FPM** multi-container setup.

### 🌐 Networking & External Services
As requested, this setup is designed to connect to services (MySQL, Redis, MinIO) already present on your host or VPS.
-   **`host.docker.internal`**: Used within the container to reach the host machine.
-   **`extra_hosts`**: Configured in `docker-compose.yml` to bridge the container-to-host gap.

### 🛠️ Local Deployment
1.  **Configure `.env`**:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Ensure DB_HOST=host.docker.internal
    # Ensure REDIS_HOST=host.docker.internal
    ```
2.  **Run with Docker Compose**:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d --build
    ```
3.  **Access**: The app is available at `http://localhost`.

---

## 🚀 CI/CD with Jenkins

The included `Jenkinsfile` provides a sophisticated deployment pipeline:
1.  **Build**: Creates a Docker image for the PHP-FPM app.
2.  **Backup**: Renames current containers for zero-downtime rollback.
3.  **Deploy**: Uses `docker compose` to spin up the new App and Nginx sidecars.
4.  **Health Check**: Automatically verifies the new deployment before finishing.
5.  **Rollback**: Automatically restores the previous version if the health check fails.

## ⚙️ Development Standards
-   **Validation**: Use `FormRequest`.
-   **Responses**: Use `JsonResource`.
-   **Business Logic**: Keep controllers thin; use `Services`.
-   **Data Access**: Always use `Repositories` via their `Interfaces`.

## 🎓 Study & Recap: The `app` Directory

A quick guide to understanding where code lives and when to use it.

| Directory | Purpose | When to use? | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`Http/Controllers`** | Entry point for requests. | Only for receiving requests, validating (via FormRequest), and returning responses. **Never** put business logic here. | `ProductController::store` |
| **`Http/Requests`** | Validation logic. | Use when you need to validate incoming data (POST/PUT). Keeps controllers clean. | `ProductStoreRequest` |
| **`Http/Resources`** | Data transformation. | Use to format how your data looks in the API response (e.g., hiding database columns). | `ProductResource` |
| **`Interfaces`** | Contracts/Blueprints. | Always create an interface before a repository. Defines *what* methods exist, not *how* they work. | `ProductRepositoryInterface` |
| **`Repositories`** | Database queries. | Use for all Eloquent/DB logic (create, find, search). **Never** call `Model::create` in a controller. | `ProductRepository` |
| **`Services`** | Business Logic. | Use for complex logic involving multiple models, calculations, or external APIs (e.g., Stripe, MinIO). | `OrderService`, `MinioService` |
| **`Models`** | Database structure. | Use for defining relationships (`hasMany`), fillable fields, and scopes. | `Product` |
| **`Observers`** | Event Listeners. | Use to hook into model events (created, updated) for side effects like Logging. | `ProductObserver` |
